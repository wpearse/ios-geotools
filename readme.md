# iOS GeoTools

iOS GeoTools is an open source collection of Objective-C classes that make GIS on iOS easier (although, there's no reason why you couldn't use these classes on Mac OS X). 

Functionality includes:

* **bounding box** - (GTBoundingBox) a bounding box represents a rectangular area, defined by two corners (north-west and south-east). You would typically use a bounding box for hit-testing a feature or zooming a map.

## Install

* Checkout the source: `git clone git://github.com/wpearse/ios-geotools.git`
* Add the `GeoTools` folder to your project
